The code follows the standard ML pipeline of Preprocessing,  exploration, modelling, iterating and insights.


#projectCount vs evaluation:
#projectCount vs averageMonthlyHours:
#averageMonthlyHours vs evaluation:

#employees who spent more hours and did more projects were evaluated highly

#What features affect our target variable the most (turnover)?
#What features have strong correlations with each other?
#Can we do a more in depth examination of these features?

#Statistical Test
#One-Sample T-Test (Measuring Satisfaction Level)
#checks whether a sample mean differs from the population mean. 

#whether the average satisfaction level of employees that had a turnover differs from the entire employee population

#Hypothesis Testing: Is there significant difference in the means of satisfaction level between employees 
#who had a turnover and the entire employee population?
